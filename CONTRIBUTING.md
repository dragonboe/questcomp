# Contributing

This is a simple, frequently-breaking script because Discord loves to rename webpack modules.

Pull requests welcome, but please:
- Only fix bugs / update webpack finders
- No big rewrites or feature additions (keeps it maintainable)
- Test on latest PTB/Canary first
- If you add something risky (auto-enroll, mass-claim) → make it optional/toggleable

Thanks for helping keep it alive.
